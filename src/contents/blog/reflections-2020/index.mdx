I've been a software developer (mostly for the web) for 6 years now. I always enjoy building products that at least solve my day to day problems.

<br />

On December of 2018, I became a senior web developer for Bentacos IT & Services. That's my first corporate job after spending my career remotely (at home) for a long time since graduating college in 2014.

<br />

October 15, 2020 was my last day for them. They told me about the termination of my services on the same day. The reason the managers gave me was that they cannot pay me anymore with my rate even though they already cut my salary by 20% back on June (in which I tried to resign but stayed for the team and the products). I remember that I felt sad on that day because I knew that it was the last day that I will be able to work with great people that I know.

<br />

Leaving made me happy as well because I was able to contribute a lot despite coming from being an independent developer to becoming their only senior web developer. I think it's something that I'm proud of.

<br />

I would like to thank all the people that I've worked with on my recent employment, you know who you are. You are all great. And I'm looking forward to meet you again in the future.

<br />

I've learned a lot this year and I will be better everyday. My goal is to be able to contribute to the society using software and not to be sad.

<br />

Today, I'm excited to announce that I will be joining Infor PSSC Inc. as a software engineer before the year ends. This has been a long process but I'm glad that I will finally be joining a new team. I'm looking forward to build and maintain great products that will help businesses as well as individuals.

<br />
