I've been a software developer (mostly for the web) for 6 years. I always enjoy building products that at least solve my day to day problems. I spent most of my career as an independent developer.

<br />

On December of 2018, I became a senior web developer for Bentacos IT & Services. That's my first corporate job after spending my career remotely (at home) for a long time since graduating college in 2014.

<br />

October 15, 2020 was my last day for them. They told me about the termination of my services on the same day. The reason the managers gave me was that they cannot pay me anymore with my rate even though they already cut my salary by 20% back in June &mdash; I resigned on the same month but I decided to stay anyway. I kind of felt sad because I knew that it was the last day that I will be able to work with great people that I know.

<br />

I took a break for a month before I started looking for a new job. It feels good to disconnect online and just have time for myself.

<br />

I've learned a lot this year and I'll make sure that I'll be better every single day.

<br />

I'm excited that I will be joining a new organization as a software engineer before the year ends. I'm looking forward to build and maintain great products that will help businesses as well as individuals.

<br />
