In building Google Chrome extensions, you may pass a query string after the specified file name on the `manifest.json`.

Example:

```json
{
  "manifest_version": 2,
  "name": "Lorem extension",
  ...
  "page_action": {
    "default_popup": "index.html?page=popup",
    "default_title": "Open Lorem extension"
  },
  "options_page": "index.html?page=options",
  ...
}
```

For this example, I added a `page` field after the `index.html` of the `default_popup`. You can then access the `page` field in your application and do something with it.

## Use case

One use case for this trick is that if you only have one entry point on your application (`index.html`) but you have different pages/ components. So to get users to a requested page, you will need the query string, set conditions and return the page depending on the field value, on this case the `page`.

If you are building an extension with Create React App, you don't need React Router. You can just get the field you need on the query string and do [conditional rendering](https://reactjs.org/docs/conditional-rendering.html).

Example on how to get specific field on a query string:

```javascript
// convert URL parameters to object
const urlParams = Object.fromEntries(
  new URLSearchParams(window.location.search)
)

// get "page" field and do whatever you want with it
const { page } = urlParams
```
